Incoming transmission…
Calling low-orbit spaceship TS31. This is Houston.
We’re not able to receive any communication from you, hopefully you’re receiving this message.
Our scans have detected a control panel failure on your ship.
The remote override of your ship is still functional, we can remotely assume control to get you back home.
However, your low-orbit radio antenna uses slow and short-range frequencies, the current transmission delay is too great for us to accurately do that from Earth.
Your trajectory will have you soon in close proximity with one of our space probes from which we can send the remote commands safely.
By the time you get this message you’ll be out of communication range from Earth. We’ll send you more instructions once you’re in range of the probe.
Godspeed.
